#'
#' Creates a parcoords-like object that can be used to customize and control a parcoords
#' that has already been rendered. For use in Shiny apps and Shiny docs only.
#'
#' Normally, you create a parcoords chart using the \code{\link{parcoords}} function.
#' This creates an in-memory representation of a parcoords that you can customize.
#' Such a parcoords can be printed at the R console, included in an R Markdown
#' document, or rendered as a Shiny output.
#'
#' In the case of Shiny, you may want to further customize a parcoords, even after it
#' is rendered to an output. At this point, the in-memory representation of the
#' parcoords is long gone, and the user's web browser has already realized the
#' parcoords instance.
#'
#' This is where \code{parcoordsProxy} comes in. It returns an object that can
#' stand in for the usual parcoords object. The usual parcoords functions
#' can be called, and instead of customizing an in-memory representation,
#' these commands will execute on the live parcoords instance.
#'
#' @param parcoordsId single-element character vector indicating the output ID of the
#'   parcoords to modify (if invoked from a Shiny module, the namespace will be added
#'   automatically)
#' @param session the Shiny session object to which the map belongs; usually the
#'   default value will suffice
#' @param deferUntilFlush indicates whether actions performed against this
#'   instance should be carried out right away, or whether they should be held
#'   until after the next time all of the outputs are updated; defaults to
#'   \code{TRUE}

  # older versions of Parcoords would have broken unless the user did session$ns
  # themselves, and we hate to break their code unnecessarily.
