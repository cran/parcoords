# parcoords | htmlwidget for d3 parallel-coordinates chart

`parcoords` gives `R` users the very well designed and interactive [`parallel-coordinates`](https://github.com/BigFatDog/parcoords-es) chart for `d3` with the infrastructure, flexibility, and robustness of [`htmlwidgets`](http://htmlwidgets.org).  `parcoords` began in the Building Widgets blog series [Week 04 | Interactive Parallel Coordinates](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2015/1/30/week-04-interactive-parallel-coordinates-1) and has been refined and improved through production usage in various disciplines.
